## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a detail-oriented and curious cloud computing fresher with a strong foundation in system administration, web development, networking, and automation. My academic background, combined with hands-on projects and self-paced labs, has helped me bridge theory with practical implementation.

I believe in learning by doing — from scripting Linux monitoring tools to integrating cloud services like EC2, RDS, and CloudWatch, I focus on building scalable solutions that reflect real-world challenges.
